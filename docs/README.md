A collection of demos using the very cool [observable-jupyter](https://github.com/thomasballinger/observable-jupyter)
Python package, which enables a new approach to data visualization with Python. 
It uses [Observable notebooks](http://observablehq.com) to bridge the gap between 
JavaScript and Python!
If you don't know JavaScript, you can use it to create a wide range of charts that use D3 other JavaScript libraries.
If you do know JavaScript, then the there's nothing that you can't do (almost).

## Observable Plot

Quick and easy charts; 
[Plot](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot) is built with D3 and powered by Observable.
